PrayerCorner
============

An app for journaling your personal prayer requests. For live demo, open link on your phone: http://medhiw.byethost3.com/?i=1

This app is a proof-of-concept of single-page-app mobile web app developed using EnyoJS Framework. http://enyojs.com/
(Enyo 2 has its roots in the framework developed to power the applications on HPâ€™s TouchPad, running on webOS. EnyoJS currently powers the applications on LG Smart TVs).

When the app is opened in a browser, it will load the app into the browser and create seed records in localStorage in the browser. The app will then run completely on the user's computer. All edits will be saved locally in the browser's localStorage database. Subsequent visit to the site will reflect the changes stored locally in the user's computer. No data is saved in any server.

I created this as a proof-of-concept prototype which I was going to turn into a Phonegap app. The app is best run on mobile phone. Tested only on Safari browser.
